// say nothing about the ground they stand on. Deleting the config line must

// #63 — a data-layer function with no caller is not a feature, and every signal
// short of this one said it was.
//
// `claimMemberWithPin` was exported from src/lib/household.js and covered by
// household.test.js ("claims a person by proving you are them, via the PIN
// route"). No component called it, so the bundler dropped it: the deployed
// bundle contained `claim_member` and not `claim_member_with_pin`. Meanwhile
// Roster.jsx correctly hid "this is me" from anyone holding a PIN, deferring to
// a flow that did not exist — and set_member_pin releases that person's phone,
// so setting a PIN locked them out.
//
// This reads source rather than behaviour, which is the same shape as the
// passWithNoTests guard above and for the same reason: the property is about
// the ground the other tests stand on, and no behavioural test can see it,
// because a unit test calls the function directly and is happy.
